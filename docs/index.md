Introducing "Conversations" - a Python package designed to
explore the true potential of conversational analysis.
With its ability to transcribe, diarise, and generate visually appealing HTML reports,
"Conversation" empowers you to delve deeper into the intricacies of human communication.
Recognizing that conversations are brimming with meaning
conveyed not just through language,
but also through key acoustic features like loudness, intonation, and speech rate,
this package brings forth an indispensable tool for understanding and
interpreting the wealth of information embedded in everyday exchanges.
`Conversations` enables you to analyze and comprehend
the complex world of human interaction.
