# Developer Guidelines

This repository uses a number of automated checks and tools. Follow these guidelines when contributing.

## Coding style
- Format code using **black**. The `review.yml` workflow automatically formats and suggests changes.
- Write docstrings in **NumPy** style. `pydocstyle` is run via the `lint-docstrings.yml` workflow.
- Type annotations are required and checked with **mypy** via `lint-types.yml`.
- Ensure spelling with **codespell** (`lint-spelling.yml`).

## Tests
- Install development dependencies with `pip install --upgrade hatch`.
- Run the full test suite with `hatch run cov`.
- If environments become stale use `hatch env prune` and `hatch env show --ascii`.

## Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions run tests (`test.yml`) on Python 3.10â€“3.12 using Hatch.
- Additional workflows lint commit messages (`commitlint.yml`) and pull request titles (`lint-pr.yml`).
- Documentation is deployed via `deploy-docs.yml` on pushes to `main`.
- Semantic releases are handled via `release.yml`.

## Documentation
- Documentation is generated with **mkdocs** using the `mkdocs-material` theme and `mkdocstrings` with NumPy docstring style (see `mkdocs.yml`).

## Expectations for Pull Requests
- Adhere to Conventional Commits for commit messages and PR titles.
- Provide thorough NumPy-style docstrings similar to those found in `conversations/_conversations.py`.
- Add or update tests in the `tests` directory for any code changes.
- Run `hatch run cov` and ensure all tests pass before committing.
